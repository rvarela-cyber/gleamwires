          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Client</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A regional grocery chain with 43 locations across the Southwest. High foot traffic. Customer-facing walkways that take a beating from carts, spills, gum, and daily wear.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Challenge</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Customer-facing walkways were inconsistent across locations. Some stores looked maintained. Others had visible gum, grease stains, and grime ground into corners. There was no standardized cleaning schedule.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Previous vendors were hit or miss. Some showed up late. Some didn't show up at all. When they did show up, the work was rushed. Corners were skipped. Gum was sprayed over, not removed.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Solution</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">We created a twice-annual preventative maintenance contract covering all 43 locations. Standardized scope of work across every store: full flat work cleaning, gum removal, corner and edge detailing, obstacle movement.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A high-end specialty retail chain with 31 mall and street-front locations. Window displays are a major part of the customer experience. Significant investment in visual merchandising.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Challenge</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Windows were the primary visual element of storefronts. Cloudy, spotted windows were undermining expensive visual merchandising investments.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Mall management at several locations had issued warnings about storefront appearance. Hard water stains at some locations had built up over years and wouldn't come off with standard cleaning.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Solution</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">We implemented monthly window cleaning for all 31 locations. Added hard water stain removal treatment for problem locations.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Created a documentation system so the visual merchandising team could coordinate window display changes with cleaning schedule. Provided 48-hour advance notice before each visit.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3">The Results</h3>
          <ul class="text-gray-600 mb-6 space-y-2">

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Client</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A regional shopping center management company with 11 properties. Mix of strip centers and larger retail developments. High tenant turnover means constant attention to property appearance.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Challenge</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Parking lot lines had faded to the point of being nearly invisible at several properties. Handicap spaces were out of ADA compliance. Fire lanes were unclear. One property had received a citation from the fire marshal.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Tenants were complaining about customer confusion in parking lots. Customers were taking up multiple spaces, blocking fire lanes, and parking in handicap spots that weren't clearly marked.</p>
          
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">The Solution</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">We completed full restriping of all 11 properties within a 30-day window. Scope included every parking space, handicap space marking with compliant signage, fire lane marking, directional arrows, and tenant-specific reserved spaces.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Created a compliance checklist for each property documenting ADA and fire code adherence. Provided before and after photos plus detailed documentation for property records.</p>
